* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

* User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

* User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

* User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

    createdy_by integer references User(id) on delete cascade,
    time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

## PollOption

    (id serial primary key,
    poll_id integer references Poll(id) on delete cascade,
    option text);

## Users

    (id serial primary key,
    username varchar(50) unique,
    email text unique,
    password_hash varchar(60) NOT NULL);

## Vote

    (id serial,
    poll_id integer references poll(id) on delete cascade,
    option_id integer references pollOption(id) on delete cascade,
    voted_by integer references user(id) on delete cascade);
